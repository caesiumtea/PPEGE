# Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained

This repo is where I'm completing the exercises from the book [Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/). I won't be doing every single one.

I would theoretically like to license my solutions under the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/), but since the book and its exercises are under a proprietary license, I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that. Licensing is hard.
